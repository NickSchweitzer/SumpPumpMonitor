# SumpPumpMonitor
The Sump Pump Monitor project is a combination of IoT Device and 
Azure Portal that is intended to allow the monitoring of one or many 
household Sump Pumps.

## Architectural Components
### IoT Sump Pump Monitor
This is based on the Intel Edison platform, and uses two different
sensors in order to monitor the Sump Pump:
* [eTape Water Level Sensor](https://www.parallax.com/product/29131)
* [Current Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11005) to Monitor On/Off Status and Electrical Usage of the Pump

### Azure IoT Data Injestion
This portion of the project runs on Azure, and takes in data
generated by the IoT monitor, and pushes the Data to Azure Storage:
* Azure IoT Hub - Accepts messages from Edison Sump Pump Monitor
* Azure Web Job - Processes Messages
* Azure Table Storage - Inexpensive Storage used for all data collected

### Azure Monitoring Portal
This portion of the project runs on Azure as well, and allows 
someone to monitor the current status of the pump, change settings
on the pump, and look at historical data.
* ASP.NET Core 
* Aurelia Single Page Application
